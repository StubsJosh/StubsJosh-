 # Hello There.

<p>Hello I am Joshua stubbs and I am a web development student at polytechnic university for ASU. 
  This is my second year taking web dev and what I am hopping to do after I finish is to take a long vacation to japan with my mother, we have always been thinking of traveling and it would be nice. Some hobbies I have been off and on are swimming and being part of a runners group who does 5ks every Thursday, and some future plans I hope to also learn more about calisthenics. I also wanted to go to my first anime convention as well and some time this year I was going to travel to FWA up in georga, a furry convention. 
</p>
<br>
<p>Some technical skills I have or had a opportunity to learn was a couple different coding languages like Python, java and html-css which I also had went onto w3schools to learn a little bit about. More skills out of my past was learning photoshop and illustrator and also learning a couple different video editing programs like Sony Vegas and others. Another that I am working on but not that skilled in is Clipart studios a full art program that I have as well.  </p>
